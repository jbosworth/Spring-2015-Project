	<c3 text="Thanks for stopping by the library today! Are there any questions I can answer for you?" num="1"></c3>
	<c1 text="Yeah, actually. Studying on campus seems to be pretty fun, but do you have any study abroad trips through UD?" num="2"></c1>
	<c3 text="We do! In fact, we have one of the highest ranked study abroad programs in the nation. For any semester, including winter and summer terms, you can choose from a variety of programs and travel to a variety of countries." num="3"></c3>
	<c3 text="You can even apply for trips which aren’t specifically in your major, as long as you have all the prerequisites which might be needed." num="4"></c3>
	<c2 text="Is there a limit on how many times you study abroad?" num="5"></c2>
	<c3 text="There isn’t a limit, but many students find it too expensive to study abroad every year." num="6"></c3>
	<c1 text="Are there scholarships or anything available?" num="7"></c1>
	<c3 text="Yes, any student who applies by a certain deadline is considered for merit-based and need-based scholarships." num="8"></c3>
	<c1 text="How early is the deadline?" num="9"></c1>
	<c3 text="It can be as early as 9 months before the program actually starts." num="10"></c3>
	<c2 text="I guess that makes sense. Are there opportunities like that which aren’t so far away?" num="11"></c2>
	<c3 text="Yes: in the Service Learning Scholar Program, a student works on a service-learning or community-based research project for ten weeks in the summer for a community agency in Delaware." num="12"></c3>
	<c3 text="Students in this program spend most of their time working in the community, but they spend a quarter of their time in academic reading, discussion, and reflection too. Projects can be conducted in any major, but a proposal must first be submitted about the intended project before the student is accepted into the program." num="13"></c3>
	<c2 text="Is that volunteer work?" num="14"></c2>
	<c3 text="It is volunteer work by nature, but the student receives a stipend for spending and a stipend for housing too." num="15"></c3>
	<c1 text="That’s so cool. Are there other opportunities to do research on campus?" num="16"></c1>
	<c3 text="Yes, the Center for Undergraduate Research has many opportunities in all research-oriented majors. You can work under a professor on his or her research project for pay, volunteer, or academic credit." num="17"></c3>
	<c3 text="The website for the Center of Undergraduate Research provides information about programs elsewhere in the country and even international research programs too." num="18"></c3> 
	<c3 text="It also has information on doing a Senior Thesis and Summer Scholars Program, where a student conducts his or her own project – whether research or creative work – under the close supervision of a professor." num="19"></c3>
	<c2 text="Wow, there are so many opportunities here! Thanks for answering all my questions." num="20"></c2>
	<c3 text="No problem! Have a great day." num="21"></c3>
