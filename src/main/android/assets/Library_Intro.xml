	<Message text="Now that you've arrived at the library, your mission is to uncover secrets about undergraduate research and off-campus opportunities offered through UD. 
	You will then be quizzed on this information, and you must get at least 3/4 of the answers correct in order to pass this mission. If you get a lower score, you will need to come back here later, which will slow you down in the race!
	What are you waiting for? Time to get started!"> </Message>
