	<Message text="Congratulations! You have been chosen as a contestant for UDiscover, a competition in which 5 teams of two complete missions around the University of Delaware campus to prove their knowledge about on-campus resources. Your goal is to complete each mission as fast as you can: in order to complete a mission, you must discover all important information in target building, then answer at least 5 questions correctly on the missionâ€™s trivia game. If you answer fewer than 5 questions correctly, you need to retry the mission, which jeopardizes your position in the race! The first team to complete all six missions wins the grand prize of a $100 Main Street gift card. Begin by choosing a partner."></Message>
