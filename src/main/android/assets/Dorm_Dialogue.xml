	<c2 text="There are so many deadlines in college! How do you remember when everything happens?" num="1"></c2>
	<c1 text="The Academic Calendar can be found on the UD Office of the University Registrar website. It lists all of the important dates for each semester, including winter and summer terms." num="2"></c1>
	<c2 text="What kind of important dates?" num="3"></c2>
	<c1 text="Stuff like when is the last day you can withdraw from a class without it affecting your GPA and when finals begin and end." num="4"></c1>
	<c2 text="When is the last day you can withdraw from a class without academic penalty?" num="5"></c2>
	<c1 text="It’s always 9 weeks after the semester starts, but the class still shows up on your transcript with a W next to it for “Withdrawn”. However, the deadline to drop a class without getting a W on your transcript is the same deadline to add a new course: 2 weeks after the semester starts." num="6"></c1>
<c2 text="How do you drop or add a new class?" num="7"></c2>
<c1 text="You can do it all online through the UDSIS. You just use the same log in and password as for your UDel email, and you can access information about your class schedule, exams, and the courses you need for your major. You can also order transcripts, fill out a change of major form, register for classes, and other things like that. Let me show you how some of it works!" num="8"></c1>
