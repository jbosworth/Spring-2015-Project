	<c3 text="Welcome to the Office of Academic Enrichment! How can I help you today?" num="1"></c3>
 	<c2 text="It sounds like some of the classes we have to take are really hard. Is there any way we can get extra help outside of class?" num="2"></c2>
	<c3 text="Yeah actually, there’s a bunch of tutoring services available on campus.  You can find any sort of tutor through the Office of Academic Enrichment if you prefer to meet with a tutor one-on-one," num="3"></c3>
	<c3 text="but there are also group tutoring sessions available, like the ones available at the ISE Lab Learning Community Center for freshman-year science and math courses. You can also go to the main department office for the class that you’re struggling with." num="4"></c3> 
	<c3 text="For example, there’s a Physics Help Center and a Math Tutorial Lab, and if you need help in Chemistry, you can just go to the main office in Brown Lab to ask for a list of tutors for your class." num="5"></c3>
	<c2 text="Woah, that’s a lot of tutors! Do you have to pay for them?" num="6"></c2>
	<c3 text="Well, if you get an individual tutor you do have to pay unless you get free tutoring through a special program. But some of the group tutoring is free, and the Physics Help Center and Math Tutorial Lab are both free for all students!" num="7"></c3>
	<c1 text="What if you struggle with writing? Are there writing tutors?" num="8"></c1>
	<c3 text="Even better: there’s even a Writing Center on campus if you need help writing a paper." num="9"></c3>
	<c1 text="How does the Writing Center work?" num="10"></c1>
	<c3 text="It’s a free service for any member of the UD community. You just need to schedule an appointment, but you can only schedule two per week at most." num="11"></c3> 
	<c3 text="When you go in, a consultant will help you with the assignment you need to work on by teaching you about sentence structure and how to edit a piece of writing." num="12"></c3>
	<c2 text="So the consultant doesn’t actually proofread your paper for you?" num="13"></c2>
	<c3 text="No, that’s not their job. They’re meant to help you learn how to be a better writer in general, not just for you to get an A on one paper. But there are other resources available depending on what you need help with." num="14"></c3> 
	<c3 text="For example, there are separate writing assistance programs for students who are multilingual and students writing in a foreign language." num="15"></c3>
	<c1 text="That’s pretty cool! But what if you just need help learning how to study for a college test since it’s so different from high school?" num="16"></c1>
	<c3 text="The website for the Office of Academic Enrichment has some Online Workshops that help you with study skills in general, like time management, studying strategies, test-taking, and goal setting." num="17"></c3>
	<c3 text="It even has a section to help you declare a major if you’re not sure what you want to study yet." num="18"></c3>
	<c2 text="That's such a good idea. I have NO IDEA what I want to major in yet!" num="19"></c2>
	<c3 text="Don't worry, you have time to figure that out! Is there anything else I can help you with today?" num="20"></c3>
 	<c1 text="No, I think you've answered all our questions. Thanks so much!" num="21"></c1>
