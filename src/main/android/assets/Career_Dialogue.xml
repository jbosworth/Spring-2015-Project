	<c3 text="Welcome to the Career Services Center! How may I help you?" num="1"></c3>
	<c2 text="Is this the right place to come if I'm considering switching my major?" num="2"></c2>
	<c3 text="Of course! Here at the Career Services Center, we provide answers to how different majors connect to possible careers. We may also direct you to your advisor or online workshops through the Office of Academic Enrichment for more help with seeing how a particular major might tie do different careers." num="3"></c3>
	<c3 text="The Undergraduate Research Office can also be helpful if you’re considering a career in research. Through the Student Portal located on our website, you can even explore your values, skills and interests through our Self Exploration tool, and you can check out possible careers pertaining to your major as well as graduate school options if you are considering an advanced degree." num="4"></c3>
	<c2 text="Once I decide on a major, how can I work on my career path?" num="5"></c2>
	<c3 text="We have numerous valuable resources here to help you with that. We hold workshops on resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and interviews. We also sponsor networking opportunities with potential employers and career fairs." num="6"></c3>
	<c2 text="How do I hear about these opportunities?" num="7"></c2>
	<c3 text="You will receive some information about networking opportunities and career fairs via email from your department, but you can look at our website to see all of our workshops, networking opportunities, career fairs, job openings, and other events." num="8"></c3>
	<c3 text="Under the Student Portal that I just mentioned, you can visit our Professional Preparation and Application sections to help you prepare for interviews, career fairs, complete job and grad school applications, and edit your resume." num="9"></c3>
	<c1 text="I heard resumes are really important. Is there any way I can get my resume checked by a professional to make sure it looks good?" num="10"></c1>
	<c3 text="Of course. In fact, we offer free resume reviews from 2:00 – 4:00 pm every week day. It is a free walk-in service available to all students." num="11"></c3>
	<c1 text="That’s awesome. One last thing – I parked in the Perkins Parking Garage behind this building and I am wondering if it’s free to park there?" num="12"></c1>
	<c3 text="Unfortunately, it is only free if you use it for 15 min or less." num="13"></c3>
	<c1 text="In that case, I’m gonna stop by the Perkins Student Center next door to get some coffee. Thanks again for all your help!" num="14"></c1>
